libwww-perl: Distribution Information</H1>

Copyright (c) 1994 Regents of the University of California.<P>

<STRONG>libwww-perl</STRONG> is a library of Perl4 packages which
provides a simple and consistent programming interface to the
World-Wide Web.  This library is being developed as a collaborative
effort to assist the further development of useful WWW clients and
tools.  The library is based on version 4.036 of the <A
HREF="http://www.cis.ufl.edu/perl/">Perl Programming Language</A>.<P>

<STRONG>libwww-perl</STRONG> is freely available as described in
the <A HREF="Artistic.txt">Artistic License</A> which accompanies the
standard distribution.  The <EM>libwww-perl</EM> software
architecture and standard distribution package are copyrighted by the
University of California for the sole purpose of retaining consistency
and coherence in the distribution of the library.  Contributions to the
library are strongly encouraged and will be included in the standard
distribution with full citation to the developers.  
See below for the list of past and current contributors.<P>

A <STRONG><A NAME="list">mailing list</A></STRONG> has been
established for technical discussion about <EM>libwww-perl</EM>,
including problem reports, interim fixes, suggestions for features,
and contributions.  The mailing list address is
<PRE>
     libwww-perl@ics.uci.edu
</PRE>
and administrivia (including subscribe requests) should be sent to
<PRE>
     libwww-perl-request@ics.uci.edu
</PRE>
A <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/WebSoft/libwww-perl/archive/">Hypermail
Archive</A> of the mailing list is also available.<P>

A <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/WebSoft/libwww-perl/contrib/">contrib
directory</A> has been established for perl source that is not (yet)
part of the libwww-perl package, but which may be useful to current
implementors.<P>

Support for the initial development and distribution of <EM>libwww-perl</EM>
has been provided by the <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/atUCI.html">
Arcadia Project at UCI</A>, part of the larger 
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/">Arcadia Consortium</A> for 
research in software engineering environments.<P>

<H2>WWW Requests Currently Supported</H2>

<DL>
<DT><A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Proxies/References.html">
Proxies</A> <DD>Full support is provided for redirecting WWW requests
by protocol scheme to a proxy server via the HTTP protocol.

<DT>HTTP/1.0 <DD>All requests and responses for the 
<A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/HTTP2.html">
Hypertext Transfer Protocol</A> are supported.

<DT>FILE <DD>Support for GET and HEAD requests on file://localhost URLs
is provided, with results translated to HTTP responses as if they were
handled by an HTTP gateway.
</DL>

<H2>Tools based on libwww-perl</H2>

The following tools use libwww-perl and are available at their
own distribution sites:
<DL>
<DT> <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/WebSoft/MOMspider/">MOMspider</A>
<DD> The Multi-Owner Maintenance spider created by Roy Fielding.
<DT> <A HREF="http://www.stuff.com/cgi-bin/bbcurn?user=bcutter&pkg=w3new">
     w3new</A>
<DD> Extract a list of URL's from either your mosaic hotlist or from a
     HTML document, retrieve their Last-modified dates, and output a HTML
     file with the URL's sorted by their last modification time.  
</DL>


<HR>
<H2>Contributors</H2>

Developing code to handle all the request formats and protocols present
on the World-Wide Web is too big a task for any one person or organization.
For that reason, the future of this library is dependent on the contributions
of those who make use of it.  Please send in your extensions so that we can
all benefit from the effort required to make distributed information systems
work.<P>

<H2>The Distribution</H2>

For easy distribution, <EM>libwww-perl</EM> is available as a
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/WebSoft/libwww-perl/libwww-perl-0.40.tar.gz">
gzip'd tar file</A> or as a 
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/WebSoft/libwww-perl/libwww-perl-0.40.tar.Z">
compress'd tar file</A>.  It is also available via 
<A HREF="ftp://liege.ics.uci.edu/pub/arcadia/libwww-perl/">anonymous
ftp</A> from <EM>liege.ics.uci.edu</EM> in the directory
<CODE>/pub/arcadia/libwww-perl</CODE><P>
